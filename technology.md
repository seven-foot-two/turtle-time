# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
We'll be using Pandas to perform EDA and to clean the dataset.  Python will be used for further analysis.

## Database Storage
We'll be running the data on an OVH server using AlmaLinux as the distro, and we'll connect it to a Postgres database.  In addition, a web scraper will be created with Python to ensure the most recent UFC data available will be stored.

## Machine Learning
We'll be using SciKitLearn as our ML library in order to create a classifier. To start, this will be a simple logistic regression to make sure the model works properly with the dataset.  Our training and testing data will be split using the standard 80:20 ratio. We will also be experimenting with Python's AutoML libraries in an attempt to increase performance.

## Dashboard
We'll be creating an interactive dashboard using Metabase.
